 * The main function will be used as one of the application thread: readGroundstationThread
 * It will be in charge of initializing the ev3: ev3_init ev3_port_init ev3_tacho_init ev3_sensor_init
 * then initializing our specific ev3 ports: my_init_ev3
 * Then it will initialize every shared data and mailbox,
 * Then it will wait for ground station connection:  WaitClient
 * Then it will create the threads
 * Then it will read the ground station orders using fscanf on the inStream
 * Protocol:
 * q\n -> quit
 * p pow\n -> current power to be set to pow
 * r x y alpha\n -> current position and heading should be reset to (x,y,alpha)
 * m 0|1\n -> set the mode to MODE_DIRECT (0) or MODE_AUTO (1)
 * S\n -> stop
 * F\n -> direct Forward
 * B\n -> direct Backward
 * L\n -> direct Left
 * R\n -> direct Right
 * g x y\n -> auto goto (x,y)
 * Note : when fscanf returns EOF, this means the ground station closed the connection, and
 * the application should stop.
 * Before exiting, we should send the quitting information to the other threads,
 * in order to cleanup (stop engines, close sockets, etc.)
 * Cleanup made in this thread, after making sure that every other thread is finished (pthread_join):
 * Every motor should be stopped, inStream should be closed
